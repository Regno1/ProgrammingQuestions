# Process Tasks Using Servers

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given two  **0-indexed**  integer arrays `servers` and `tasks` of lengths `n`​​​​​​ and `m`​​​​​​ respectively. `servers[i]` is the  **weight**  of the `i​​​​​​th`​​​​ server, and `tasks[j]` is the  **time needed**  to process the `j​​​​​​th`​​​​ task  **in seconds**.

Tasks are assigned to the servers using a  **task queue**. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is  **empty**.

At second `j`, the `jth` task is  **inserted**  into the queue (starting with the `0th` task being inserted at second `0`). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the  **smallest weight**, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the  **smallest index**.

If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned  **in order of insertion**  following the weight and index priorities above.

A server that is assigned task `j` at second `t` will be free again at second `t + tasks[j]`.

Build an array `ans`​​​​ of length `m`, where `ans[j]` is the  **index**  of the server the `j​​​​​​th` task will be assigned to.

Return  *the array* `ans`​​​​.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: servers = [3,3,2], tasks = [1,2,3,2,1,2]
Output: [2,2,0,2,1,2]
Explanation: Events in chronological order go as follows:
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 2 until second 1.
- At second 1, server 2 becomes free. Task 1 is added and processed using server 2 until second 3.
- At second 2, task 2 is added and processed using server 0 until second 5.
- At second 3, server 2 becomes free. Task 3 is added and processed using server 2 until second 5.
- At second 4, task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 5.
- At second 5, all servers become free. Task 5 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: servers = [5,1,4,3,2], tasks = [2,1,2,4,5,2,1]
Output: [1,4,1,4,1,3,2]
Explanation: Events in chronological order go as follows: 
- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 1 until second 2.
- At second 1, task 1 is added and processed using server 4 until second 2.
- At second 2, servers 1 and 4 become free. Task 2 is added and processed using server 1 until second 4. 
- At second 3, task 3 is added and processed using server 4 until second 7.
- At second 4, server 1 becomes free. Task 4 is added and processed using server 1 until second 9. 
- At second 5, task 5 is added and processed using server 3 until second 7.
- At second 6, task 6 is added and processed using server 2 until second 7.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- servers.length == n
- tasks.length == m
- 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 105
- 1 <= servers[i], tasks[j] <= 2 * 105
